* Built the front-end with REACT, JAVASCRIPT, JSX, CSS, AXIOS, and REACT
ROUTER.

* REACT set up the foundation for this application and made it faster as it created
a virtual DOM which only changed components that were mounted or updated.

* Knowing JAVASCRIPT and all the different data types helped me manipulate
data to control my REACT application.

* Built the server with NODE JS and EXPRESS with different endpoints to Create,
Read, Update, and Delete data from my own server.

* Features a search capability from EDEMAM API for other Ketogenic Diet
Recipes.
